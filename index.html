  <h1>Pausing Operations Until 2031</h1>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Weâ€™re taking a six-year (6-year) pause so our team can focus on laying a solid foundation behind the scenes. Right now, weâ€™re designing systems, building infrastructure, and planning every detail to ensure that when Laius Group officially launches in 2031 with headquarters in Warsaw, we deliver top-quality digital agency and cloud hosting services. Laius Group isnâ€™t just about services - itâ€™s about creating a new standard. Weâ€™re fusing tech and creativity into tools that empower businesses, creators, and communities around the globe. Long-term thinking, built from the ground up.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Not Launch Now?</h2>
  <p>
    We could launch early - but weâ€™d rather do it right. Building world-class tools, servers, and systems takes time. We want everything to be chefâ€™s kiss from day one.
  </p>

  <h2>What We're Working On</h2>
  <p>
    Our team is building everything you need for a seamless digital experience: from tailored website design and eye-catching graphic assets, to social media management, brand kit creation, intuitive UI/UX workflows, video editing, and digital marketing strategies. On the cloud side, weâ€™re laying the groundwork for a robust platform offering VPS hosting, website hosting, cloud storage, and WordPress hosting - both managed and unmanaged.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Itâ€™s Worth the Wait</h2>
  <p>
    Pausing operations gives us the time and focus to perfect every detail before we launch. Weâ€™re researching cutting-edge infrastructure, refining our processes, and ensuring rock-solid reliability (99.994% SLA*). This strategic break also helps us build a strong team culture, implement transparent pricing, and create automated workflows so you get the best service from day one in 2031.
  </p>

  <h2>What to Expect</h2>
  <p>
    In 2031, expect blazing-fast infrastructure, insanely good design, and a Gen-Z-powered agency that just gets it. Weâ€™re not building a basic service - weâ€™re creating something unforgettable.
  </p>

    Thank you for your patience and support. We canâ€™t wait to show you what weâ€™ve built. See you in 2031! ðŸ‘‹<br>
    *SLA not guaranteed. 99.994% is our target based on current infrastructure planning, but itâ€™s subject to change before launch.
